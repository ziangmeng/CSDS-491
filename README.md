# CSDS-491
#This course is a graduate-level introduction to Artificial Intelligence (AI), the discipline of designing intelligent systems, and focuses on probabilistic graphical models. These models can be applied to a wide variety of settings from data analysis to machine learning to robotics. The models allow intelligent systems to represent uncertainties in an environment or problem space in a compact way and reason intelligently in a way that makes optimal use of available information and time. The course covers directed and undirected probabilistic graphical models, latent variable models, associated exact and approximate inference algorithms, and learning in both discrete and continuous problem spaces. Practical applications are covered throughout the course. Prereq: CSDS 391 or Requisites Not Met permission.
